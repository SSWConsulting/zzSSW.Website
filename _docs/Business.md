# Business

The purpose of SSW.Website is to provide a central place for SSW to market their services and abilities to clients, users, potential employees and those interested in the latest technologies that professionals are using in the industry.

## The Problem

The previous version of the SSW Website was created using old technology, and didn't provide an easy way of editing the content of the website.

On top of this, there were many pages on the old website that were outdated or not being used anymore, and needed to be addressed.

## The Goals

- Recreate the SSW Website as a static website
- Improve the content editing experience for stakeholders
- Remove unused pages from the website

## Statement of Intent

The intent of this project is to recreate the SSW Website using Gatsby 4. All approved content from the current website will be migrated into the [SSW.Website.Content](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.Website.Content) repository and used as data to create the pages for the website programatically. 

At the current time, only the Consulting / Services pages will be transferred over to this new website. With the other sections planned to come at a later date.
