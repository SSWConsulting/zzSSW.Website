# Alternative Solutions Considered

We chose to go through with a static website solution because we wanted to improve loading time over the existing SSW Website. Much of the content displayed is static, and doesn't change often. So a static website was the clear direction.

We chose Gatsby over NextJs or Blazor because more of our developers are familiar with Gatsby.

We chose Azure over on-premises because the costing for this website is quite low.
